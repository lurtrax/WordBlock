like how it works in the iphone

no word by word

Autocomplete you'd have to do letter by lettrr

Not by itself no

That won't be autocomplete

the markov chain sentence creator i made

What is "this"

yeah I'm going to extend this into a system wide auto complete

Well it was autocomplete basically

that's what I wanted to build with this lol

Yeah

Actually simon a text predictor given a dictionary/usages was one of our projects in 61b

I know what they are

Nooo Facebook data lol

Much like how the text prediction thing works on the iPhone

It generates a random sentence based on a text's word usage

The markov chains?

https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1zlsze/about_how_much_money_do_top_streamers_such_as/cfut60u

It's modern art ok

Hehe*

"Quality" we

Unless you structure it like this: simon Behar photography is the epitome of quality

Well one of your photos was completely dark; so they're not exactly synonyms

They both mean the same thing

Venkat you don't need to say "quality" and "Simon Behar photography" in the same sentence.

Bahahahahaha it just gets better and better

Check my snapstory

Btw is there any quality simon Behar photography from last night

But you gotta get the alcoloho in!!!1!

Simon, this is for you

LA Jolla I think

Anyone know which beach Megan went to?

Also fuck I forgot my charger at megans

O ok

No I get NOW haha

That's worse

You're incorrectly racist

Yea?

It's a double entendre it's like it doesn't work because it's not a black stereotype and then also like black people don't have jobs (don't work)

Sorry I'm not racist enough

Good

I'm offended

Yeah Cayla what the shit

Idk where Mexicans came in to the equation

So to get his computer to run faster he paints it black and it doesn't work

Black people stereotypically run faster than others

That's it

I thought the joke was that it doesn't work

Mexicans run fast

Wut

That's a Mexican thing

OH WTF

Carla you're retarded

What's not to get lol

Blacj people run faster

Uh

Not internet enough

I don't get it

Plz pay me for round 2

Fuck, sorry.

Yeah we're gonna have to message people.

I'm still out ~80 + dollars

Yeah we should

Kk I'll stop being sensitive. Next time though should really put a jar by the alcohol or something

I'm not

It's just super awkward when you ask people for money and then someone loudly whines "don't do this now, do it while everyone's leaving and be like "hey guys if you could throw in some money that'd be chill". Don't blame me for that...

Round 2 tonight tho with board games and video games

Ask ven

I don't fucking know lol

Why would you listen to toma

I'm sure if you message the people who showed up that you invited they'll Venmo you

Fucking toma

I know shouldn't have listened to her at all

"Stop doing that, do it as everyone's leaving"

Dude toma's like

You can just text me to pick you up... Had to take the dog out

Should've kept collecting when I said to :/

Fucking Venkat left me at Megan's

Diet generally has a distinct aftertaste

Real sugar is wat better for mixed drinks but yeah you're probably right

Like "omg is this real sugar" when im 12 shots deep

no one cares when they're plastered.

Fuck it I'll just bring it anyway

I like it, but it is diet, which tastes different from regular sugar

Is it good?

Not picky

Fresca is the diet soda though, idk if anyone else drinks that

Kindly appreciated ^

yes that works better ty

"my friend who was visiting from uchicago" maybe?

okay cool

yeah that was unclear to me

i'll say "while he was visiting me"

yeah

he was visiting 4 years ago?

oh wait

but dave was visiting him so how would he not know?

they were estranged best friends cause his girlfriend at teh time ran off with dave

if its dave how did he not know he was dead

lol

oh shit i copied it wrong, it's my friend dave

so dave isnt that friend?

or "just so happened to be visiting me at the time"

i should add "at the time" after as it so happened i guess

the friend was visiting him

whos visiting him?

thats sort of unclear

"Four years after she ran off with my friend from UChicago, who, as it so happened, was visiting me."

500-700

yeah

seemed short

ooh was it 700 word limit

700 word limit is such a bitch

I liked it

the prompt was "an old friend has returned with a vision for the future"

also any leftover alcohol can be used later so its not a huge deal if we buy extra

btw me and bailey won't drink but i can bring food stuff

that would be like 50 total? so like 5$ a person?

yeah. lets say one handle of vodka, one cheap handle of some other liquor, and a thirty rack

Okay and a thirty rack?

if we have 12-15 people

lol yep yep yep

Hahaha I really enjoyed it

When I saw the car run the red light as I was crossing the street, I couldn't even process what was about to happen. One second I was bidding farewell to my game design professor, Dr. Krieger, and then I was dead, run over like a rat crossing the road as the light turns green. I never really believed in the whole concept of "afterlife". It always seemed that once you died, you were just done, left to decay into a resting state of carbon. To my surprise, as my last thoughts of her expired, I found myself bathed in a golden light, and an old saintly figure slowly came in to focus. Could it be? "G...God? Is that you?" "Surprised to see me? Didn't believe I existed?" "Well.... no." "It's alright, my son. Non-believers can make it to heaven too. Hell is really only for /r/atheism subs." Boy was I glad I was only a lurker. "Why'd you have to kill me so soon?" "Paul, I'm really sorry it had to end that way, but you see, I've been having a pretty big problem as of the last hundred years. It's the entire human race, Paul. They're evolving too fast. What was supposed to be a slow movement towards global communication resulted in 4chan, Paul. They're out of control, and I need your help." "Why me, though? I haven't even graduated yet!" "As an omnipotent being, Paul, I see what's in your head, even if you're only a lurker. I see the spark in your brain each time you read League of Legends patch notes, and while reddit may not know balance, you do. Plus, you got a 99% on the final you took right before you died. Funnily enough, the only point you missed on your pitch for a game was on death sequences... something about them being too short?" "Goddamnit." "Exactly!" I let out a sigh. "Anyway, I guess I can try and help you out. So what have you tried so far? What's your goal?" "Well, with mobile technology advancements, I managed to slow growth by artificially capping battery life, but as soon as Elon Musk turns his attention to it, I'm screwed there too. And of course, the Greece situation was better than anything I could have hoped for. But even then, Germany will eventually bail them out. I have no clue what to do." "How about instead of trying to covertly nerf a multi-billion size population... we buff certain others? Like what if we gave dolphins the ability to survive on land too?" " Subtle Paul. I can't just stick legs on a traditionally sea-based mammal. Do you know the kind of wars that would erupt over me? All these people would have their beliefs confirmed, and the only way to prove that their method of worship is best would be to wipe out all the others. Heaven isn't something you can convince me to let you in to, by praying and such. It's simply a place to be after you're dead. And we'd have an overload of dead people if these changes went through." "How about we try and use the humans progress against themselves? Perhaps we give them a breakthrough in cloning technology, to a certain headstrong scientist who runs a little wild, and the clones prove too hard to control...?" "...Damn it, I knew I shouldn't have kept Jurassic World at the top of the box office for that long."

Prompt: "[WP] God has decided that humans are overpowered. You are in charge of patching the world to 2.0 to achieve balance.WRITING PROMPT"

Sure

anyone bored and want to read something I wrote for a reddit writing prompt

aidan talk

idk im not there yet haha

Should I head over to aidans?

I wish ucsc had interesting classes lmao

literally fuckin board games class lol

Modern Tabletop Games are undergoing a renaissance, with designers building upon each other‚Äôs innovations at a bewildering rate. The cornucopia of concepts in modern boardgaming can be daunting to a newcomer, yet any digital game designer is well-advised to familiarize themselves with this parallel world, both to expand their ‚Äúbag of tricks‚Äù and their notion of what a game can be. This class aims to familiarize students with a wide variety of ‚Äúgateway games‚Äù: relatively straightforward exemplars that will give the student a solid foothold when further exploring the genre in our extensive library of boardgames. While doing so, we will be discussing related readings in Characteristics of Games, in order to give the design strategies being engaged a broader context.

modern table top games literacy

i can also take

so much effr0t

i have to swap my english class bleh

Seems cool

cause im allowed to take a two credit class with my current schedule

Yeah

the point is two credit course thats really fucking fun

well yeah i could teach it on other games but that's not the point lol

I could fuckin teach that class

This class will involve the development of a high level understanding of the real time strategy game, Starcraft 2, including optimizing early gameplay, mastering tactical maneuvers and strategies, and real-time strategic decision making. At the same time it will touch on the development of the industry of e-sports and the design of high-level multiplayer games. Finally, the class will emphasize honing the universally valuable skills of critical thinking, mental discipline, and understanding complex systems and data in real-time, the very skills that make for a world class Starcraft player.

What's it entail

looks so fun

legit

its part of the game design curriculum

lol noob

intro to starcraft

nevermind i can't fit it this semester

aw man

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I CAN TAKE INTRO TO STARCRAFT

FUCK YES

because i get more credit towards my major if i do this rather than wasting time learning web design cause a core class was closed

for discrete math and theory of probability

i have to switch out web design and honors analysis

^what.

let's play help venkat swap all of his math classes!

Also just us 3? Lol

Why so late Ûæå∫

I don't have gas to drive to evans and then to Costco lol. Evan can you drive over to my house

Can we pick up at like 1

I am. Ven pick up at 12:30?

Who's going to pool

So what's the plan rn

at moms house

Jacob where are you

also illyas relationship to shirou is same thing

whereas zero spoils it right away (bc it assumes you know fsn spoilers)

and its a huge surprise

9/10th the way in

but like yeah reading fsn you dont know the two are sisters until like

okay I will read it next time I explore fate world

lolol

:(

or fuckin read it

ill probably rewatch f/sn after I finish it

is a big thing

but like you arent supposed to know the two girls are sisters when reading hf

yeah

reading f/sn first you get the sense that he's like a pretty good guy but saber hates him and then you see him in zero and you can see why

ruthless af

he p scary

basically

yea

you should know hf before watching thats how its intended but a lot of ppl watch zero first

like I think if I hadn't seen any of unlimited I would hate him rn

but like

itll prolly make sense at the end

yah idk I like kiritsugu but he confuses me

tbh first season i didnt really like much (i couldnt stand lancer). second season is really good.

heavens feel would explain a lot :<

it explains a lot

most of the spoielrs i wanted you to avoid were in first ep

well if you watched the first episode then just finish it

/r/coontown still exists

the binge was real

Funny thing is

yesterday

i see

oooh

jacob i watched like most of fate zero

just wanted to ask actual redditers

Rip /r/fatpeoplehate

oh okay

which is a big no no

which further alienated the reddit community

about issues

she went to talk to news outlets

Don't go on New York Times

instead of talking to the community about issues

York

You were probably on new UOL times

but yah i could see tumblers saying that

oh also

no it was on new york times actually

yah the reddit community doesn't seem very about that

tumblrs not bad

Don't go on tumblr

You were probably on tumblr Mathew

thats not why lol

that seems weird

and i was like

it was just like it was cuz she a woman

see i read an article which didn't really go into that

oh okay

not giving enough power to mods

etc

deleting subreddits, deleting posts criticizing her, she got rid of a popular admin that basically made it impossible to do AMAs

wait why were people trying to remove her on reddit

We did it reddit

Holy shit Ellen pao resigned

sure

board games and boba later?

B o w l I n g b o y z

and bc it still downloading i guess

i can't listen now because i'm listening to stereopony tho

Ven

And nobwe dont

yessssss

Yesss matthew

;)

Bowl

Do we not have leftovers from last time?

What do you guys wanna do

No we dont

do we have stuff?

Ven and Jacob?

we can go to beach and chill

yeah

Simon/ven/Jacob?

Cayla can't Megan can't Aidan cant

Who's free to do stuff tonight

Reddit thing

Ûæå≥

wut.

you just said rip in peace

Isn't that your thing? Rip in peace fake ID Ûæå∫

Lul

Do you has voddy

Bloody Mary's????

Any kind of stuff you choose I'm literally down for anything

What kind of stuff we talkin avout

Idk but I'm down to do stuff

So what we doing tonight?

3deep5me

i should totally fucking do that lol

honestly

but now i have to add stuff to it otherwise i might as well print a picture and send it to MoMA

that's exactly the message i'm supposed to convey

It's like commentary that nyu bloggers don't have anything to say

In "just another nyu blog"

That there's no posts

It's somewhat artistic

i like the header though

https://wp.nyu.edu/projectvenway/

yeah i am but im stuck on the first post

do it

except it'll have to contain mostly legal thoughts

and share it with everyone you know

and you guys should all read it

this is why i should start a blog

^

just a dip into venkats everyday thoughts

though i don't know if that qualifies as a pun

i know jacob but it doesn't have a shitty pun does it!

The joint delivery thing already exists

I guess not

"the underground drum circle"

but does it have a shitty slavery pun attached?

both illegally and legally

they already kind of have that

my joint delivery idea was fucking gold

you'll see once i have any skills to put my ideas into action it'll all work out

just a dip into venkats everyday thoughts

"how can we get them to do as little as possible?"

then the question becomes

answer? as little as possible

"what does the consumer want?"

you gotta think

netlix shouldn't take effort

see that takes effort simon

so SKYPE DOESN'T KEEP FUCKING BUGGING OUT

And Skype?

with an integrated voice function that pauses your show so you can speak together

You mean press play at the same time?

so you can watch stuff together at home

like, a way to synchronize your netflix or something with other people

you know what would be a really good idea

if you get matthew then sure

Ok then wow it is

k sorry simon im staying home im way too tired

kind of a far trip

its in the si wong desert

from stellan?

we should explore natural substances. i hear cactus juice is all the rage these days

agre

it's probably best to just stay away from drugs. who needs them to have fun?

plus like i heard you can overdose sometimes if you're not super careful

blehh

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

its kind of illegal or something

but idk

TRU

i hear that stuff makes nothing really fun

we should SMOKE WEED

guys

Anything really

Board games? LAN party? Boba?

OP is a bundle of sticks confrimed

lol

what do you wanna do simon

Wow

You guys are literal faggots

I should go on shark tank

Lmfao hunter

I've decided that I will not work out and just watch TV on my laptop in bed instead

Thank you for all your suggestions!

Actually I have a better idea, purchase a selfie stick and put your phone on that playing your TV, and then make a ductape harness that holds the selfie stick out in front of you at all times so you can safely monitor the tv

Sup

I'll try the duck tape thing when i get home

Hunter ÛæÆ°

Lul

like how mitt romney had his dog outside of the car

i think it was a joke

Why is that anyrhinf to be proud of

On another note how does a dog ride outside of a Prius

Yeah Jesus Christ can you BE any more obnoxious about it

Haha the next level liberal one?

Also Simon that snapchat was almost painful to look at

In Simons defense New York is probably just as jewish as tel aviv

So Aidan doesnt come home at 6 to a bunch of intoxicated assholes trashing his house

I mean my house is meat free lol someone else has to bring burgers

No drinking or smoking until you clean up a little bit

Doenst it

Buns and condiments

Guys we should start cleaning aidans house when we go over at 4

Venkat

WE SHOULD COOK CARDIFF CRACK FROM SEASIDE MARKET.

Next to the pool

If you want I can bring buns and some condiments or whatever I can find in my pantry and we can make burgersb
